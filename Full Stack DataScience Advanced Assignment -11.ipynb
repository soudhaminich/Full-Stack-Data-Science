    "##Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is itself an instance of a metaclass. A class in Python defines how the instance of the class will behave. In order to understand metaclasses well, one needs to have prior experience working with Python classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q2. What is the best way to declare a class's metaclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to do this, but one way is to set __metaclass__ at the module level. This way, all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass, and we just have to tell the metaclass to turn all attributes to uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorators are much, much simpler and more limited -- and therefore should be preferred whenever the desired effect can be achieved with either a metaclass or a class decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything you can do with a class decorator, you can of course do with a custom metaclass (just apply the functionality of the \"decorator function\", i.e., the one that takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's __new__ or __init__ that make the class object!-).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things you can do in a custom metaclass but not in a decorator (unless the decorator internally generates and applies a custom metaclass, of course -- but that's cheating;-)... and even then, in Python 3, there are things you can only do with a custom metaclass, not after the fact... but that's a pretty advanced sub-niche of your question, so let me give simpler examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to make a class object X such that print X (or in Python 3 print(X) of course;-) displays peekaboo!. You cannot possibly do that without a custom metaclass, because the metaclass's override of __str__ is the crucial actor here, i.e., you need a def __str__(cls): return \"peekaboo!\" in the custom metaclass of class X.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies to all magic methods, i.e., to all kinds of operations as applied to the class object itself (as opposed to, ones applied to its instances, which use magic methods as defined in the class -- operations on the class object itself use magic methods as defined in the metaclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q4. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although metaclasses allow you to customize class creation in multiple ways (see Item 48: “Validate Subclasses with __init_subclass__” and Item 49: “Register Class Existence with __init_subclass__”), they still fall short of handling every situation that may arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say that I want to decorate all of the methods of a class with a helper that prints arguments, return values, and exceptions raised. Here, I define the debugging decorator ."
