    "##Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance a feature of some object-oriented programming languages in which a class or an object inherits characteristics and properties from more than one parent class or object. This is contrary to the single inheritance property, which allows an object or class to inherit from one specific object or class. Although there are certain benefits associated with multiple inheritance, it does increase ambiguity and complexity when not designed or implemented properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation is an object oriented technique (also called a design pattern). Let's say you have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. You can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method you're interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programmers can easily implement delegation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component. This relationship means that a Composite has a Component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is an object oriented design concept that models a has a relationship. In composition, a class known as composite contains an object of another class known to as component. In other words, a composite class has a component of another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition allows composite classes to reuse the implementation of the components it contains. The composite class doesnâ€™t inherit the component class interface, but it can leverage its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition relation between two classes is considered loosely coupled. That means that changes to the component class rarely affect the composite class, and changes to the composite class never affect the component class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides better adaptability to change and allows applications to introduce new requirements without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q4. What are bound methods and how do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument. It passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions. In Python 3 and newer versions of python, all functions in the class are by default bound methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods that do not have an instance of the class as the first argument are known as unbound methods. As of Python 3.0, the unbound methods have been removed from the language. They are not bounded with any specific object of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main problems that the pseudoprivate attribute feature is meant to alleviate has to do with the way instance attributes are stored. In Python, all instance attributes wind up in the single instance object at the bottom of the class tree.\n"
