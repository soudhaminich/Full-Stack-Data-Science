    "##Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "Regular expressions are useful in search and replace operations. The typical use case is to look for a sub-string that matches a pattern and replace it with something else. Most APIs using regular expressions allow you to reference capture groups from the search pattern in the replacement string.\n",
    "These back references effectively allow to rearrange parts of the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q2. Describe the difference between the effects of \"(ab)c+\" and \"a(bc)+.\" Which of these, if any, is the unqualified pattern \"abc+\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't have any effect .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q3. How much do you need to use the following sentence while using regular expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl.\n",
    "Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (str) as well as 8-bit strings (bytes). However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with a byte pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.\n",
    "Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q4. Which characters have special significance in square brackets when expressing a range, and under what circumstances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Square Brackets\n",
    "Square brackets ([ ]) designate a character class and match a single character in the string. Inside a character class, only the character class metacharacters (backslash, circumflex anchor and hyphen) have special meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must use a backslash when you use character class metacharacters as literals inside a character class only. Square brackets that are used as literals must always be escaped with backslash, both inside and outside a character class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [[abc] should be written: [\\[abc]\n",
    "\n",
    "Metacharacter\tMeaning\n",
    "\n",
    "\\ (backslash)\tgeneral escape character\n",
    "\n",
    "^ (circumflex anchor)\tnegate the class, if this is the first character in the brackets\n",
    "\n",
    "(If ^ is not the first, it is not a metacharacter.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q5. How does compiling a regular-expression object benefit you?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s re.compile() method is used to compile a regular expression pattern provided as a string into a regex pattern object (re.Pattern). Later we can use this pattern object to search for a match inside different target strings using regex methods such as a re.match() or re.search().\n",
    "In simple terms, We can compile a regular expression into a regex object to look for occurrences of the same pattern inside various target strings without rewriting it.\n",
    "Syntax of re.compile()\n",
    "re.compile(pattern, flags=0)\n",
    "1.\tpattern: regex pattern in string format, which you are trying to match inside the target string.\n",
    "2.\tflags: The expression’s behavior can be modified by specifying regex flag values. This is an optional parameter\n",
    "There are many flags values we can use. For example, the re.I is used for performing case-insensitive matching. We can also combine multiple flags using OR (the | operator).\n",
    "Return value\n",
    "The re.compile() method returns a pattern object ( i.e., re.Pattern).\n",
    "How to compile regex pattern\n",
    "1.\tWrite regex pattern in string format\n",
    "Write regex pattern using a raw string. For example, a pattern to match any digit.\n",
    "str_pattern = r'\\d'\n",
    "2.\tPass a pattern to the compile() method\n",
    "pattern = re.compile(r'\\d{3})\n",
    "It compiles a regular expression pattern provided as a string into a regex pattern object.\n",
    "3.\tUse Pattern object to match a regex pattern\n",
    "Use Pattern object returned by the compile() method to match a regex pattern.\n",
    "res = pattern.findall(target_string)\n",
    "Example to compile a regular expression\n",
    "Now, let’s see how to use the re.compile() with the help of a simple example.\n",
    "Pattern to compile: r'\\d{3}'\n",
    "What does this pattern mean?\n",
    "•\tFirst of all, I used a raw string to specify the regular expression pattern.\n",
    "•\tNext, \\d is a special sequence and it will match any digit from 0 to 9 in a target string.\n",
    "•\tThen the 3 inside curly braces mean the digit has to occur exactly three times in a row inside the target string.\n",
    "In simple words, it means to match any three consecutive digits inside the target string such as 236 or 452, or 782.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q6. What are some examples of how to use the match object returned by re.match and re.search?\n",
    "\n",
    "re.match() function of re in Python will search the regular expression pattern and return the first occurrence. The Python RegEx Match method checks for a match only at the beginning of the string. So, if a match is found in the first line, it returns the match object. But if a match is found in some other line, the Python RegEx Match function returns null.\n",
    "For example, consider the following code of Python re.match() function. The expression “w+” and “\\W” will match the words starting with letter ‘g’ and thereafter, anything which is not started with ‘g’ is not identified. To check match for each element in the list or string, we run the forloop in this Python re.match() Example.\n",
    " \n",
    "re.search(): Finding Pattern in Text\n",
    "re.search() function will search the regular expression pattern and return the first occurrence. Unlike Python re.match(), it will check all lines of the input string. The Python re.search() function returns a match object when the pattern is found and “null” if the pattern is not found\n",
    "How to use search()?\n",
    "In order to use search() function, you need to import Python re module first and then execute the code. The Python re.search() function takes the “pattern” and “text” to scan from our main string\n",
    " \n",
    "For example here we look for two literal strings “Software testing” “guru99”, in a text string “Software Testing is fun”. For “software testing” we found the match hence it returns the output of Python re.search() Example as “found a match”, while for word “guru99” we could not found in string hence it returns the output as “No match”.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q7. What is the difference between using a vertical bar (|) as an alteration and using square brackets as a character set?\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternation (OR) |\n",
    "Alternation is the term in regular expression that is actually a simple “OR”.\n",
    "In a regular expression it is denoted with a vertical line character |.\n",
    "For instance, we need to find programming languages: HTML, PHP, Java or JavaScript.\n",
    "The corresponding regexp: html|php|java(script)?.\n",
    "A usage example:\n",
    "let regexp =/html|php|css|java(script)?/gi;\n",
    "\n",
    "let str =\"First HTML appeared, then CSS, then JavaScript\";\n",
    "\n",
    "alert( str.match(regexp));// 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'\n",
    "We already saw a similar thing – square brackets. They allow to choose between multiple characters, for instance gr[ae]y matches gray or grey.\n",
    "Square brackets allow only characters or character classes. Alternation allows any expressions. A regexp A|B|C means one of expressions A, B or C.\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "•\tgr(a|e)y means exactly the same as gr[ae]y.\n",
    "•\tgra|ey means gra or ey.\n",
    "To apply alternation to a chosen part of the pattern, we can enclose it in parentheses:\n",
    "•\tI love HTML|CSS matches I love HTML or CSS.\n",
    "•\tI love (HTML|CSS) matches I love HTML or I love CSS.\n",
    "Example: regexp for time\n",
    "In previous articles there was a task to build a regexp for searching time in the form hh:mm, for instance 12:00. But a simple \\d\\d:\\d\\d is too vague. It accepts 25:99 as the time (as 99 minutes match the pattern, but that time is invalid).\n",
    "How can we make a better pattern?\n",
    "We can use more careful matching. First, the hours:\n",
    "•\tIf the first digit is 0 or 1, then the next digit can be any: [01]\\d.\n",
    "•\tOtherwise, if the first digit is 2, then the next must be [0-3].\n",
    "•\t(no other first digit is allowed)\n",
    "We can write both variants in a regexp using alternation: [01]\\d|2[0-3].\n",
    "Next, minutes must be from 00 to 59. In the regular expression language that can be written as [0-5]\\d: the first digit 0-5, and then any digit.\n",
    "If we glue hours and minutes together, we get the pattern: [01]\\d|2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d.\n",
    "We’re almost done, but there’s a problem. The alternation | now happens to be between [01]\\d and 2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d.\n",
    "That is: minutes are added to the second alternation variant, here’s a clear picture:\n",
    "[01]\\d  |  2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d\n",
    "That pattern looks for [01]\\d or 2[0-3]:[0-5]\\d.\n",
    "But that’s wrong, the alternation should only be used in the “hours” part of the regular expression, to allow [01]\\d OR 2[0-3]. Let’s correct that by enclosing “hours” into parentheses: ([01]\\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\\d.\n",
    "The final solution:\n",
    "let regexp =/([01]\\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\\d/g;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q8. In regular-expression search patterns, why is it necessary to use the raw-string indicator (r)? In   replacement strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw String Notation\n",
    "According to Python docs, raw string notation (r\"text\") keeps regular expressions meaningful and confusion-free. Without it, every backslash ('\\') in a regular expression would have to be prefixed with another one to escape it. For example, the two following lines of code are functionally identical −\n",
