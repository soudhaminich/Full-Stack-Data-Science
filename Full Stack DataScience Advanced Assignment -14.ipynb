    "\n",
    " Augmented assignment operators have a special role to play in Python programming. It basically combines the functioning of the arithmetic or bitwise operator with the assignment operator.  Any compiler worth its salt will generate exactly the same machine-language sequence for both constructs for any built-in type (int, float, etc) as long as the statement really is as simple as x = x + a; and optimization is enabled. (Notably, GCC's -O0, which is the default mode, performs anti-optimizations, such as inserting completely unnecessary stores to memory, in order to ensure that debuggers can always find variable values.)\n",

Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
