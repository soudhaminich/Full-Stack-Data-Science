    "\n",
    "In order to use non-ASCII characters, Python requires explicit encoding and decoding of strings into Unicode. In IBM® SPSS® Modeler, Python scripts are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8, which is a standard Unicode encoding that supports non-ASCII characters. The following script will compile because the Python compiler has been set to UTF-8 by SPSS Modeler.\n",

    "Binary File\n",
    "\n",
    "It represents a custom data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can easily get corrupted, corrupt on reflects as even single bit change\n",

    "##Q5. How can you interpret a Unicode text file containing text encoded in a different encoding than your platform's default?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't depend on the file having a BOM. UTF-8 doesn't require it. And non-Unicode encodings don't even have a BOM. There are, however, other ways to detect the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-32\n",
    "\n",
    "BOM is 00 00 FE FF (for BE) or FF FE 00 00 (for LE).\n",
    "\n",
    "But UTF-32 is easy to detect even without a BOM. This is because the Unicode code point range is restricted to U+10FFFF, and thus UTF-32 units always have the pattern 00 {00-10} xx xx (for BE) or xx xx {00-10} 00 (for LE). If the data has a length that's a multiple of 4, and follows one of these patterns, you can safely assume it's UTF-32. False positives are nearly impossible due to the rarity of 00 bytes in byte-oriented encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "US-ASCII\n",
    "\n",
    "No BOM, but you don't need one. ASCII can be easily identified by the lack of bytes in the 80-FF range.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8\n",
    "\n",
    "BOM is EF BB BF. But you can't rely on this. Lots of UTF-8 files don't have a BOM, especially if they originated on non-Windows systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can safely assume that if a file validates as UTF-8, it is UTF-8. False positives are rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, given that the data is not ASCII, the false positive rate for a 2-byte sequence is only 3.9% (1920/49152). For a 7-byte sequence, it's less than 1%. For a 12-byte sequence, it's less than 0.1%. For a 24-byte sequence, it's less than 1 in a million.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-16\n",
    "\n",
    "BOM is FE FF (for BE) or FF FE (for LE). Note that the UTF-16LE BOM is found at the start of the UTF-32LE BOM, so check UTF-32 first.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you happen to have a file that consists mainly of ISO-8859-1 characters, having half of the file's bytes be 00 would also be a strong indicator of UTF-16.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the only reliable way to recognize UTF-16 without a BOM is to look for surrogate pairs (D[8-B]xx D[C-F]xx), but non-BMP characters are too rarely-used to make this approach practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "XML\n",
    "\n",
    "If your file starts with the bytes 3C 3F 78 6D 6C (i.e., the ASCII characters  <?xml ), then look for an encoding= declaration. If present, then use that encoding. If absent, then assume UTF-8, which is the default XML encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to support EBCDIC, also look for the equivalent sequence 4C 6F A7 94 93.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if you have a file format that contains an encoding declaration, then look for that declaration rather than trying to guess the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the aboveThere are hundreds of other encodings, which require more effort to detect.\n",

    "##Q7. What qualifies ASCII text as a form of Unicode text?\n",
    "\n",
    "For backward compatibility, the first 128 Unicode code points represent the equivalent ASCII characters. Since UTF-8 encodes each of these characters with a single byte, any ASCII text is also a UTF-8 text. Unicode is a superset of ASCII.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as shown above, many Unicode files cannot be used in an ASCII context. Any character that is out-of-bounds will be displayed in an unexpected manner, often with substituted characters that are completely different from those that were intended.\n",
