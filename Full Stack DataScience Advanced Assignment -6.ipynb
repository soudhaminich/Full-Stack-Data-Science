    "##Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception handling is used when the frequency of occurance of an exception cannot be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "you provide a web form for users to fill in and submit.but incase there are a lot of conditions to be handled and the conditions keeps changing periodically,you use exception handling to simplify the process\n",
    "\n",
    "Database connectivity uses exception handling(why???) this is because the reason for database connectivity failure cannot be predicted and handled as it can be caused by many variables such as power failure, unreachable server,failure at client front/back end and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic exceptions such as division by zero and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating systems use exception handling to resolve deadlocks,recover from crash and so forth\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "If an exception is not caught (with a catch block), the runtime system will abort the program (i.e. crash) and an exception message will print to the console. The message typically includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "name of exception type\n",
    "\n",
    "short description\n",
    "\n",
    "stack trace\n",
    "\n",
    "For a checked exception, a method must either catch an exception (handle internally) or claim it (declare that it will be thrown)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is enforced by compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claiming an exception is giving information to the caller, so that they will know to catch it!\n",
    "\n",
    "For an unchecked exception (runtime exception), there's no compiler enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime exceptions could occur anywhere, arising automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually can be fixed by better coding\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Division by zero, array index out of bounds, null pointer exception\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, exceptions can be handled using a try statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical operation which can raise an exception is placed inside the try clause. The code that handles the exceptions is written in the except clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations, you might want to run a certain block of code if the code block inside try ran without any errors. For these cases, you can use the optional else keyword with the try statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try statement in Python can have an optional finally clause. This clause is executed no matter what, and is generally used to release external resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unhandled exception displays an error message and the program suddenly crashes. To avoid such a scenario, there are two methods to handle Python exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Try – This method catches the exceptions raised by the program\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise – Triggers an exception manually using custom exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, keywords else and finally can also be used along with the try and except clauses. While the except block is executed if the exception occurs inside the try block, the else block gets processed if the try block is found to be exception free.\n",
    "\n",
    "The finally block consists of statements which should be processed regardless of an exception occurring in the try block or not.\n"
